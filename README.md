# Dean-Project-Sorter

This project can be run in Eclipse or JGrasp. To start the program, run the Runner class in the runner package, then type in the file path for the Preferences csv file and the Topic List csv file.

Miss Dean is an English teacher at Issaquah High School. Every year she gives her juniors a list of 150 research topics to choose from. The students would hand her a notecard with their first, second, and third choice topics, then Ms. Dean had to expend an enormous amount of brainpower figuring out a configuration of research project assignments that would allow everyone to get at least one of those three choices.

This Java project automates the assignment process. Instead of handing in notecards, the students put their topic choices into a Google Form. The results are converted into an Excel comma seperated values file, which is then passed into this project as an input. The project spits out a list of who gets which research topic.
